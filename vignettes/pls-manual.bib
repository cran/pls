The overall performance of the estimators is compared in terms of their bias, variance and squared error. The results indicate that the 0.632 estimate and leave-one-out cross-validation are preferable when one can afford the computation. Otherwise adjusted 5- or 10-fold cross-validation are good candidates because of their computational efficiency.},

With the aid of this proof the original kernel algorithm developed by Lindgren et al. (J. Chemometrics, 7, 45 (1993)) is modified to provide two faster and more economical algorithms. The performances of these new algorithms are compared with that of De Jong and Ter Braak's (J. Chemometrics, 8, 169 (1994)) modified kernel algorithm in terms of speed and the new algorithms are shown to be much faster. A very fast kernel algorithm for updating PLS models in a recursive manner and for exponentially discounting past data is also presented. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
